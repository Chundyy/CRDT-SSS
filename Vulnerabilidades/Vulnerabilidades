Semantic Bugs in Merge Function:
        Incorrect merge logic leading to data corruption
        Failure to handle edge cases properly

    Identifier Reuse/Collapsing:
        Reusing the same identifier causes semantic merging issues
        Example: two operations with same ID appear as one

    State Growth via Key Collisions/Duplication:
        Duplicate keys cause exponential state growth
        Example: repeated insertions of same key-value pair

    Clock Dependency Issues:
        Clock desynchronization causing incorrect ordering
        Example: two updates with same timestamp appearing out of order

    Malicious State Injection/Equivocation:
        Injecting invalid or conflicting states
        Example: claiming to have higher clock value than actually present

    Metadata Escalation/Bloat:
        Accumulation of unnecessary metadata causing resource exhaustion
        Example: storing too many historical versions

    Replay/Rewind/Ordering Attacks:
        Replaying old updates to disrupt consistency
        Rewinding clock to force older state
        Ordering attacks to manipulate conflict resolution

    Privacy/Data Exposure:
        Leaking sensitive information through state sharing
        Example: revealing private data in public updates

    Gossip/Transport Layer Weaknesses:
        Vulnerabilities in the gossip protocol implementation
        Transport layer attacks affecting message delivery

    Byzantine Fault Tolerance Issues:
        Specialized attacks targeting Byzantine CRDTs
        Example: manipulating failure detectors

    Denial of Service (DoS):
        Flooding with updates to overwhelm processing
        Resource exhaustion attacks

    Eclipse Attacks:
        Isolating nodes to prevent proper synchronization
        Preventing nodes from receiving updates

    Data Poisoning:
        Injecting corrupted or malicious data
        Example: injecting NaN values in numerical CRDTs
